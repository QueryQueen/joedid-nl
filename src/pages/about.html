      <h3>Never get bored </h3>
      <p>My life is a party decorated with my sweet husband, cute little girl, two dogs, a big vegetable garden, some chickens, vintage treasure hunting and windsurfing holidays. I also love cupcakes and icecream, so I need to do some sports sometimes as well (running, beachvolleybal, mountainbiking). I really do not get how you could possibly get bored. So many fun things to do. In general I love to make things (grow). Whether this is furniture, software or vegetables. Or my daugther Sophie. Some dedication, love and sunshine can get you a very long way. Growing veggies? Also build a greenhouse, make jam, pickles and your own compost. You want a bathtub but it wont fit in your tiny house? Build one outside. I love to smash things with a breaker, but I also have a collection of delicate English teacups. Pink nails, dirty hands. That's typically me.    </p>
