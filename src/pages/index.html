      <h3>Nice to meet you! </h3>
      <p>It was about time. My journey into the world of programming has already started and you surely wouldn't want to miss it! So what is going to happen? Before you know it, I will be programming like a pro. In the meantime I will keep track of my progress on this very website. Which I created myself by the way. So writing code is my new way of creating things. But I already have some experience making stuff in other ways. So you can read a bit about what I made so far. In the garden, our house and on my laptop!  </p>
