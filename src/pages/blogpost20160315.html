			<p>Some hobbies tend to get out of hand. Maybe gardening is one of such hobbies for me, we actually bought our house mainly because of the garden. Each year we made a lot of progress into realising our dreamgarden. New fencing, cute chickens, small fruit trees and of course our vegetable garden &hearts;! But living in the cold and rainy Netherlands, growing tomatoes and cucumbers already seems like a tropical dream. So I got itchy hands and wanted to try building my own greenhouse. We did a try-out with a small elevated tunnel greenhouse. It worked wonders! This made us decide to build a big one this time.  </p>
			<p>From online research to design and material selection, to actual building, it took us about a year to do it. Maybe we overdid it a little bit, the final result is a greenhouse of 28 square meters :). But like you can never have too many boardshorts, I am positive that a greenhouse cannot be too big. The greenhouse is built from wood and covered with foil. We used a combination of new, reclaimed and second hand materials to keep the costs reasonable. <a href="DIYGreenhouse.html">Read the full story on how we built the Greenhouse here.</a></p>
			<p>The plan is to grow many different sorts of tomatoes, cucumbers, some eggplants, paprika and peppers in the greenhouse this year. My big dream is to one day grow my own melon... Keep on dreaming!</p>
